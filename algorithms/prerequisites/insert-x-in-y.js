// Assignment: Insert X in Y
// Write a program that inserts a new number X at an index Y. For example if array = [1, 3, 5, 7] and X = 10, and Y = 2, by the end of your program array should be [1, 3, 10, 5, 7] (in other words we added '10' on index 2). Check the output of your array once your program is completed to make sure it's working correctly

var arr = [1, 3, 5, 7];
function insertXinY(arr, x, y){
  arr.splice(y, 0, x);

}

insertXinY(arr, 10, 2);
console.log(arr);
