// Assignment: Reversing
// Given an array X of multiple values (e.g. [-3,5,1,3,2,10]), write a program that reverses the values in the array.  Once your program is done X should be in the reserved order.  Do this without creating a temporary array.  Also, do NOT use the reverse method but find a way to reverse the values in the array (HINT: swap the first value with the last; second with the second to last and so forth)

var arr = [-3, 5, 1, 3, 2, 10];
